# Single sign-on is coming to the B.C. government’s GitHub organizations 

:sparkles: The Developer Experience team has enabled Single Sign-On (SSO) for GitHub. We’re starting with the bcgov GitHub organization. After we finish transitioning bcgov, we’ll enable other OCIO-managed GitHub organizations.

By **July 30, 2024**, all bcgov GitHub organization users must link their IDIRs with their GitHub IDs. If this isn’t done by the deadline, access to the GitHub organization will be automatically removed. 

Contractors without IDIRs must order one before SSO can be enabled.

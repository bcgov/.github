# Single sign-on is coming to the B.C. governmentâ€™s GitHub organizations 

ðŸ”” We're enabling single sign-on (SSO) for GitHub. Weâ€™re starting with the bcgov GitHub organization. After we finish transitioning bcgov, weâ€™ll enable other OCIO-managed GitHub organizations. 

To keep access to the bcgov GitHub organization, all users must link their IDIRs to their GitHub IDs betweenâ€¯June 30th and July 30th, 2024. If users donâ€™t complete this by July 30th, 2024, theyâ€™ll be automatically removed from the bcgov GitHub organization, and by extension, all the code repositories connected to bcgov. 

Contractors without IDIRs must get one to before they can enable SSO. Learn how to order an IDIR.
